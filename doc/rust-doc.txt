INTRODUCTION                                         *rust-doc.vim-introduction*

*rust-doc.vim* searches documents in your crate and opens it by browser.  You
can use 3 interfaces to open them.

- |:RustDoc| command for detailed search
- |K| mapping in your Rust code to search under the cursor
- |unite.vim| source to list up all candidates and select one


==============================================================================
INSTALL                                                   *rust-doc.vim-install*

If you use some plugin manager, please follow the instruction of them.
For example, you can install this plugin with |neobundle.vim| as below.
>
    NeoBundle 'rhysd/rust-doc.vim'
<
Otherwise, copy all directories and files in "autoload", "plugin" and "doc"
directories to your "~/.vim" directory's corresponding directories.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                       *rust-doc.vim-usage*

As described above, 3 interfaces are available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. |:RustDoc| command

    *:RustDoc* {crate-or-module} [{identifier}]            *rust-doc.vim-:RustDoc*

        You can search the documents in your crate with crate name or module
        name with identifier.  Identifier is a name of constant, trait, struct
        and so on.

        For example, assume your crate uses "rand" crate.

>
        (1) :RustDoc rand
        (2) :RustDoc rand::distributions
        (3) :RustDoc rand Rng
<

        (1) opens the document for crate rand.
        (2) opens the document for module rand::distributions.
        (3) opens the document for trait rand::Rng.

    *RustDocFuzzy* {identifier}                       *rust-doc.vim-:RustDocFuzzy*

        |rust-doc.vim| searches the documents in your crate with {identifier}
        fuzzily.  It lists up all possibilities and you can select one of
        them.  If only one candidate exists, |rust-doc.vim| opens it instantly.

        e.g.
>
        :RustDocFuzzy distributions
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. |K| mapping in your Rust code                          *rust-doc.vim-K-mapping*


    |rust-doc.vim| automatically overwrites default |K| mapping only in Rust
    code.  The K mapping opens most corresponding document in your crate.
    It is available in normal mode and visual mode.  In normal mode, the word
    under the cursor is used.  In visual mode, the selected text is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. |unite.vim| source                                  *rust-doc.vim-unite-source*

    You can select from all document candidates in your crate with unite.vim
    interface.
>
    :Unite rust/doc
<

==============================================================================
VARIABLES                                               *rust-doc.vim-variables*

g:rust_doc#vim_open_cmd                                *g:rust_doc#vim_open_cmd*

Vim command to open the path to a document.  |rust-doc.vim| uses it to open the
document if it is not empty.  The command must take a URL to the local file.


g:rust_doc#open_cmd                                        *g:rust_doc#open_cmd*

Shell command to open the path to a document.  |rust-doc.vim| uses it to open
the document if it is not empty.  The command must take a URL to the local
file.


g:rust_doc#do_not_ask_for_module_list
                                         *g:rust_doc#do_not_ask_for_module_list*

If the value is 1, |rust-doc.vim|| never ask if it shows the list of
modules/identifiers when no document is found.
The default value is 0.


g:rust_doc#define_map_K                                *g:rust_doc#define_map_K*

If the value is 1, |K| mappings described above is defined.
The default value is 1.
